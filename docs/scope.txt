SCOPE
-----

This document talks about an inital scope for a preliminary model of our system, ready for 06/02/2020.

1 - Control and Monitor power usage and state of in home IoT
2 - Basic user management page (mock)
3 - Simple Automation
4 - Recommender
5 - Social Media? (tweet avg daily household usage for example)


Control and Monitor power usage and state of in home IoT
--------------------------------------------------------

# Devices:
- Thermostat
- Boiler
- Lights
- Smart TV
- Plugs?

# Functions:

- General
-- provide usage statistics
-- provide usage recommendatations
-- show faults in devices

- Heating
-- change thermostat temperature
-- turn heating off and on

- TV
-- change channel
-- volume
-- inputs
-- on/off
-- colour saturation and brightness etc

- Lights
-- on off
-- intensity
-- colour (a la philips hue lights)

- boiler
-- on/off
-- water temperature

- Plugs
-- on/off


# Information:
- Device identifiers (device ID, device name, device type)
- Device state (on/off, channel (TV), temperature (heating/boiler), light colour/intensity (lights)
- Usage data (per device) (total used today so far, history of daily totals, usage on an hourly basis (detailed diagrams))
- Automation events (how the fuck?)

Table 1: list of devices
- deviceID
- mac addr
- device name
- device type ID (FK)
- fault?

Table 2: list of device types
- device type ID
- device type (txt)

Table 3: TV state
- device ID
- on?
- channel
- input (ENUM HDMI1/2, ANT, DVD, VIDEO)
- volume (0-100%)
- colour sat
- brightness

Table 4: Thermostat state
- device ID
- on?
- temp

Table 5: Boiler state
- device ID
- on?
- temp

Table 6: Plug
- deviceID
- on?

Table 7: Lights
- deviceID
- on/off
- intensity
- colour (RGB)

Table 8: Usage Statistics
- deviceID
- usage right now (kw)
- usage this hour (kwh)
- usage every hour previous (kwh) (NOTE enables detailed power breakdown, may be unscalable)

ROOM TABLE: HOUSE HAS ROOMS, ROOMS HAVE DEVICES


# Services:

What services should our controller provide our view?

- JSON data about usage statistics of a device
-- ask for an interval (hourly, daily) and a range (between 9am and 5pm) (every hour between 12am and 8pm yesterday)

- adding devices??

- JSON data for device information
-- fault status
-- on/off status
-- device specific params

- Recommendations
-- based on the current state information
-- grabbed by view polling the controller for new update suggestions

- User Settings
-- only for mock, stored as variables in the controller rather than database

- Social Media
-- based on the current state information
-- grabbed by view polling the controller for new social media updates
-- if you've used less power than average, offer to tweet "look at me, i've used x% less power than the national average!"

- Automation
-- start off with time based state changes for simples
-- need good plan, will probably become more obvious as time goes on
